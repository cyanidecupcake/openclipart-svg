<title>Approximation of circle by Bezier</title>
<desc>
	This clip demonstrates the power of Bezier curves.

	Inspired by Adam Stanislav's E-Book "BÃ©zier Circles and other shapes" I tried to
	compare different approximations of a circle by Bezier curves.

	The circle is the blue line.

	The green solid line is the approximation of a half circle by a single Bezier curve.
	The approx is not exact but already very good when you consider how few parameters are used.

	The dashed magenta line is the approximation with two Bezier curves as discussed by Adam in his book.
	The two lines are almost identical, there is no visible difference.

	I used an approximation of Adam's Kappa from the continued fraction to get integer numbers for the coordinates.
	The only fraction with a denominator divisible by 3 is 169/306 (besides 5/9 which is not good enough).
	169/306 = 0,5522875816993464...
	  Kappa = 0.5522847498307933...
