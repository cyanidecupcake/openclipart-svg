# Openclipart-svg
Collections of SVG files originally available on Openclipart.org.

The prolonged downtime of Openclipart.org has been troublesome for many, including myself, who regularly used Openclipart.org for sourcing graphics for projects. Since it seems like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openclipart](Openclipart could be down) for a long period of time and might never reopend their doors to the public I thought it was time to do something about it.

This is a collection of SVG files that were originally available on Openclipart.org and have been collected from various sources. I will not lie to you, they are a mess. There is some organization from some of the files but there could very well be hundreds (possibly) thousands of duplicates. The majority of files are older collections that I was able to find from across the web.

You will find thousands of files but it is lacking a great deal of organization. The first priority was to collect as many of the orgininal SVG files as possible and store and share them for others to have access.

## What Next?
It would be nice to organize this collection and remove duplicates. After that well it can be talked about.

## Sources
The majority of these SVG files are sourced from the Wayback Machine.
